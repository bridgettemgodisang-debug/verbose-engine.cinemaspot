  <!-- Cultural Impact -->
    <section id="impact" class="container section">
  <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
  <article class="card">
    <p>
      Cinema has always been more than entertainment; it is a mirror reflecting society’s struggles, triumphs, and aspirations. 
      In recent years, films such as <em>Moonlight</em> (2016), <em>Selma</em> (2014), <em>Get Out</em> (2017), and <em>Black Panther</em> (2018) 
      have emerged as cultural landmarks, amplifying Black voices and reshaping the global narrative of representation in film. 
      These works not only achieved critical and commercial success but also carried profound social significance, challenging stereotypes 
      and opening space for new conversations about race, identity, and justice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Barry Jenkins’s <em>Moonlight</em></strong> is a deeply intimate portrait of Chiron, a young Black man navigating childhood, 
      adolescence, and adulthood in Miami. The film’s triptych structure captures the fragility of identity and the weight of masculinity, 
      while also exploring sexuality and self-acceptance. Its quiet power lies in its refusal to sensationalize; instead, Jenkins uses lyrical 
      imagery and silence to convey the unspoken pain of marginalization. Winning the Academy Award for Best Picture, <em>Moonlight</em> became 
      the first film with an all-Black cast and a queer protagonist to receive Hollywood’s highest honor, a milestone that signaled a shift in 
      whose stories are deemed worthy of recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Ava DuVernay’s <em>Selma</em></strong> situates itself firmly in historical struggle. Chronicling the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches 
      led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the film dramatizes the fight for voting rights against entrenched racism in Alabama. DuVernay’s direction 
      emphasizes both the collective courage of activists and the systemic barriers they faced, from discriminatory registrars to violent law enforcement. 
      Released during renewed debates about racial justice, <em>Selma</em> resonated as both a history lesson and a call to action, reminding audiences 
      that the fight for equality is ongoing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Jordan Peele’s <em>Get Out</em></strong> redefined horror by embedding racial critique within its chilling narrative. Following Chris, 
      a young Black man visiting his white girlfriend’s family, the film exposes the insidious nature of liberal racism and exploitation. Peele’s genius 
      lies in using genre conventions—suspense, paranoia, body horror—to dramatize the anxieties of Black existence in predominantly white spaces. 
      The film sparked widespread discourse on race relations, privilege, and systemic oppression, proving that horror can be both entertaining and 
      socially incisive. Its success, including an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, validated the idea that genre cinema can carry profound 
      cultural weight.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Ryan Coogler’s <em>Black Panther</em></strong> shattered box office records while offering a vision of Afrofuturism that celebrated African 
      heritage and innovation. Set in the fictional nation of Wakanda, the film presented a technologically advanced society untouched by colonialism, 
      a radical reimagining of Africa’s place in global culture. With its predominantly Black cast and themes of leadership, diaspora, and responsibility, 
      <em>Black Panther</em> became a cultural phenomenon, inspiring pride and sparking conversations about representation in mainstream media. Its Oscar 
      nominations, including Best Picture, marked a watershed moment for superhero films and for Black storytelling in Hollywood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together, these films demonstrate the <strong>power of cinema to amplify marginalized voices</strong>. They challenge audiences to confront 
      uncomfortable truths, whether about systemic racism, historical injustice, or the complexities of identity. They also prove that Black stories 
      are not monolithic: <em>Moonlight</em> whispers of personal pain and resilience, <em>Selma</em> shouts of collective struggle, <em>Get Out</em> satirizes 
      hidden prejudice, and <em>Black Panther</em> imagines a liberated future. Each contributes uniquely to a broader tapestry of representation, expanding 
      the possibilities of what Black cinema can be.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cultural significance of these works lies not only in their artistry but in their impact. They have inspired new generations of filmmakers, 
      opened doors for diverse narratives, and reminded audiences worldwide that representation matters. By centering Black voices, they reclaim space 
      in an industry that has long marginalized them, offering stories that are both universal and deeply rooted in specific cultural realities. 
      In doing so, they affirm that cinema is not just about telling stories—it is about shaping the world we live in.
